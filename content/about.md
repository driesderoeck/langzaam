## What is this all about?
I grew up in a small village in Belgium, where we had street signs that told car drivers to slow down. One day, I took a photo of such a street sign and figured it might be fun to turn it into a T-Shirt or something.
## Langzaam
Langzaam means slowly in Dutch. It's a reminder to ourselves that we should slow down and enjoy life to the fullest. Often the focus in our day to day lives is on bigger, better, more, stronger ... I want to create some garments to counter that idea. Less, degrowth, time with people you love. Remember, progressing with babysteps is progression too!
## Who makes this?
Langzaam is the brainchild of [@driesderoeck](https://www.twitter.com/driesderoeck) - a Belgian based researcher and designer. [www.roeckoe.be](https://www.roeckoe.be)
