What is this all about? I grew up in a small village in Belgium, where we had street signs that told car drivers to slow down. One day, I took a photo of such a street sign and figured it might be fun to turn it into a T-Shirt or something.
Langzaam Langzaam means slowly in Dutch. It&amp;rsquo;s a reminder to ourselves that we should slow down and enjoy life to the fullest.</description></item><item><title>Archive</title><link>/archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archive/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Shop</title><link>/shop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/shop/</guid><description>
Ohnoes a shop&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about running a small shop with this logo, starting with a sweatshirt. I&amp;rsquo;d love to have this produced locally (Belgium), but at this moment I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that if I get 50 replies to this form by the end of August 2021, I&amp;rsquo;ll run a first series.
